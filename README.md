# WebOS TV Integration for Unfolded Circle remotes

This integration allows the Unfolded Circle remotes to integrate with WebOS-based TVs (e.g. LG TVs) and directly control them with Websocket

Note: This repo is still in beta and is not fully stable yet. It's also missing some controls and can maybe break after updates. Please keep that in mind when you're trying to run it yourself

## Build
